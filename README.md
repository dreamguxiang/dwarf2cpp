Generate C++ headers from DWARF Debugging Information Format (DWARF).

> [!WARNING]
> This tool requires binaries that contain **DWARF debug information** in order to generate headers.
> Make sure your input binary includes DWARF debug info, which is often not publicly available in proprietary software.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started is the prebuilt package. No C++ toolchain or LLVM required.

```
uvx dwarf2cpp
```

or with pip
```
pip install dwarf2cpp
```

### Build from Source

Building from source is only needed when no prebuilt wheel is available for your platform.
Since dwarf2cpp uses **pybind11** to access LLVM's DWARF DebugInfo module from Python, it requires a working C++ toolchain:

* On Windows: **MSVC (Visual Studio Build Tools)**
* On Linux: **GCC (g++)**
* On macOS: **Apple Clang (Xcode Command Line Tools)**

```
git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/dwarf2cpp.git
cd dwarf2cpp
pip install .
```

## Usage

```
Usage: dwarf2cpp [OPTIONS] PATH

Options:
  --base-dir TEXT         Base directory used during compilation.  [required]
  -o, --output-path PATH  Output directory for generated files. Defaults to
                          'out' inside the input file's directory.
  --grouped-output-path PATH
                          Output directory for grouped generated files. Defaults
                          to 'grouped' inside the output directory.
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

The `PATH` argument must point to a binary containing DWARF debug information.

* `--base-dir` should point to the root directory used during compilation. This helps resolve relative include paths when reconstructing headers.
* `--output-path` controls where the source-order generated headers are stored. If not specified, the tool creates an `out/` folder next to the input file.
* `--grouped-output-path` controls where the grouped headers are stored. If not specified, the tool creates a `grouped/` folder inside the output directory.
* The grouped version keeps virtual functions together, data members together, and static members together. Virtual functions are ordered by vtable index when available, and data members are ordered by member offset when available.

## Examples

### Extract from `libminecraftpe.so`

```
dwarf2cpp path/to/libminecraftpe.so --base-dir D:/a/_work/1/s
```

### Extract from `bedrock_server` (Linux)

```
dwarf2cpp path/to/bedrock_server --base-dir /mnt/vss/_work/1/s
```

## Motivation / Purpose

Typical use cases include:

* Analysing the internals of proprietary software.
* Supporting the development of plugin frameworks such as **[Endstone](https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone)**.
* Research on automated source reconstruction from DWARF.

## Limitations

* Generated headers may not compile out-of-the-box. Manual adjustments may be required.
* Templates, inline functions, and macros cannot always be reconstructed accurately.
* Only works with binaries compiled with DWARF debug info. Stripped binaries will not work.
* Only trivially tested. It may fail with certain binaries.
